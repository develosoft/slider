                                            Jojoba oil on scalp works to clean the residues of blocked and encrusted sebum leading to reduced hair loss and diminished hair damage. Its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties aid to maintain the scalp clean and healthy. Its bonus property is that it solubilizes messy build up in the hair as well as air borne minute particles. Jojoba oil not only helps in making your hair clean and soft, but its kerato-plastic effect makes the hair bright and elegant.

                                          Jojoba oil acts as a natural hair serum that imparts shine and healthy look to your hair. It’s particularly useful for dry hair. You can apply a few drops of the oil to provide moisture to your hair. You can apply it to all over your hair for additional shine, or simply use it to the hair ends. If you hair is damaged by chemicals contained in hair products, harsh conditions of the weather or pollutants from the environment, use jojoba oil to lock in the moisture in the hair shaft, which will provide glow and luster to your hair.

                                           Using jojoba oil to stimulate hair growth is an excellent natural home remedy. It’s a known fact that your hair release sebum, a natural oil, to keep your hair hydrated. Sometimes extra sebum is released by the glands that can block the hair follicles. This results into hair damage and hair loss. Quite often the rate of hair growth is also obstructed because of the chocked follicles. Jojoba oil prevents hair loss and hair thinning caused by the blocked hair follicles. Jojoba oil dissolves and opens up these blockades and promotes developments of new hair cells that lead to hair growth.<br><br>

                                          Jojoba oil is an excellent natural moisturizer that is readily accepted by the scalp. As its molecular structure is similar to sebum (the scalp’s natural oil), so it does not disturb the scalp’s natural balance. Dry scalp is quite often wrongly understood as dandruff, creating tight, flaky and itching skin. Jojoba oil works to intensely moisturize scalp penetrating into the pores. This causes a deep-down and lasting hydrating solution managing the pH level of the scalp.
										  <br><br>It’s also known to have antibacterial properties that soothes the scalp and can be used to treat dandruff, dry scalp and itching. As it moisturizes your scalp deep-down to the pores, so helps in keeping your hair healthy from the roots.

                                          Jojoba oil for face cleansing is an effective way to be used as make-up remover and a facial cleaner. Soak a cotton pad in jojoba oil and apply it all over your face, and then remove the oil deposits from your face with damp cotton. This way you can remove all residues of makeup and all the impurities immediately. 
										  <br><br>
										  Jojoba oil can also be used in removing eye makeup, foundation, powders, eye shadow, liquid liner, mascara, etc. It does not have any adverse effect on eyes, but as the eye area is very delicate you will need to use it with enough care and not rub it hard. Dip a cotton ball in the oil and use it on the eye lashes.

                                           Jojoba oil has anti-microbial properties and contains iodine that prevent harmful bacteria growth, which otherwise causes pimples, blackheads, and acne breakouts.
Blocked pores quite often lead to acne and pimple formations, which are common problem with teenagers. Many of the beauty products that claim to treat acne have animal fat, which can make the problem worse. Jojoba oil is non-greasy and has capabilities to kill bacteria, so it works as an effective natural remedy for acne.

                                           Jojoba oil is not only good for face, but can be used over the body instead of your regular body moisturizer. You can apply a few drops right after a bath or shower, while skin is still wet. It locks in the moisture, keeping your skin soft and smooth. This will also help in lessening the winter itch and reign in the chapped skin, as the anti-inflammatory properties of the oil will decrease the dryness and skin irritation.
										  <br><br>
										  Alternatively, you can apply across the body before bathing. You can massage your body to stimulate blood circulation, which will provide you with radiant skin.
										  <br><br>Its pleasant aroma and non-greasy texture will provide you with a soothing feeling.

                  <p>First, for the hair, I have coarse and frizzy curls, and this oil seemed to calm that down quite a bit. I noticed my hair was softer and the curls seemed more defined than if I did not use it. I generally apply on damp hair, but it works fine on dry as well, just be wary of getting it on your roots as it will make them super greasy (even flyaways!)</p>

                  <p>I have purchased this oil online before and at the Vitamin Shoppe and Whole Foods so this brand is pretty consistent. 

I love that this oil is really close to the sebum that we naturally process. It's a very light non-greasy oil

I use the oil on my natural hair to seal my ends and oil my scalp sometimes. It leaves my hair shiny and the oil feels light on my hair.

I also use it on my body right after the shower to seal in the moisture...leaves my skin soft and ash free.

I will definitely be replenishing this oil.</p>

                  <p>This product is excellent for dry hair! I did as suggested in the instructions coming with the Jojoba Oil, and added the spoon of oil to my full bottle of shampoo. Amazing! The first time I used it: when rinsing the shampoo out of my hair is when I noticed that the hair felt different, a bit oily to the touch. At that moment I thought that maybe the amount added to the shampoo was too much, but when styling my hair, I noticed that it was perfect! </p>

                  <p>I myself get acne quite often, so I decided to try it out.
It was easy to smooth over my face, and I didn't need a whole lot to do this either, just a few drops.
It made my face feel softer.
It didn't give me that weird oily feeling that some oils do later in the day or just after applying it.
I did not notice a change in my acne, however it made my skin feel more, moisturized and fuller.</p>

From what I've been told, Jojoba is great for all kinds of skin types because it balances oil production. I have pretty dry skin, so I'll sometimes use sweet almond oil, but I really do love using this too. </p>
